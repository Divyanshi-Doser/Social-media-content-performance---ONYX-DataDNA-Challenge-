# 📊 Social-media-content-performance---ONYX-DataDNA-Challenge-

This repository contains my submission for the **Onyx Data DNA Challenge – June 2025**, where participants were tasked with analyzing a 2024 social media performance dataset using any BI tool of their choice.

## 🔍 Project Overview

The goal of this project was to uncover what makes content successful across different platforms by analyzing engagement metrics, post types, hashtags, content categories, and regional performance.

I designed a **multi-page interactive Power BI dashboard** with a final **1-page collage** for LinkedIn submission.
